# UML Calculator Stress Test Results

## Overview of Tests
Several tests were created to stress-test the UML Calculator's unique capabilities:

1. **Recursive Collapse Tests (RIS Validation)**
   - Tests that RIS(a, b) selects the lowest-entropy operation
   - Tests nested RIS logic like RIS(RIS(2, 3), 4)
   - Tests edge cases like RIS(16, 4)

2. **Magic Square of Perfect Squares**
   - Tests symbolic identity override
   - Validates pseudo-magic grids with perfect squares
   - Tests line sum uniformity

3. **TFID / Identity Trace Stability**
   - Tests stability of symbolic identities under transformations
   - Validates TFID persistence with rotated grids
   - Tests TFID breaking with value changes

4. **RIS vs Traditional Math Edge Cases**
   - Tests RIS with unstable inputs like RIS(0, 0)
   - Tests asymmetry handling with RIS(∞, 0)
   - Tests symbolic fallback with RIS(7, "unknown")

5. **Symbolic Collapse Equivalence**
   - Tests equivalence of different expressions collapsing to the same result
   - Tests nested brackets like [3,>4,5<] and [3,9<]

6. **Collapse Chain Length vs Entropy Score**
   - Tests that shorter chains yield lower entropy
   - Tests that RIS(2, 4) prefers multiplication

7. **Compression Path Divergence**
   - Tests that structurally different but symbolically similar expressions
     produce different collapse paths
   - Compares [2,×[3,+1]] vs [2×3 + 1]

8. **Impossible Grids That Work Symbolically**
   - Tests grids with duplicate perfect squares
   - Tests symbolic compression with repeated values

## Test Results
The tests revealed several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Math Module Access**: Adding math and cmath to SAFE_CONSTANTS fixed the 
   "Name 'math' is not defined or not allowed" error.

2. **RIS Function**: Added RIS function to parse_uml to handle RIS meta-operator 
   function call syntax.

3. **Grid Format Issues**: Fixed grid format in magic square tests - they were 
   being treated as dictionaries instead of lists.

4. **UML Expression Parsing**: Issues with complex UML expressions like `{10,<>5,2<>}` 
   and `×[3,+1]`. These need more robust parsing logic.

5. **TFID Stability Test**: Fixed the list rotation logic in TFID test.

6. **Import Errors**: Fixed module import paths.

## Recommendations
Based on the stress tests, here are recommended improvements:

1. **Enhance RIS Implementation**:
   - Add entropy-based operation selection
   - Support for nested RIS operations
   - Handle edge cases like zero, infinity, and symbolic values

2. **Improve UML Expression Parsing**:
   - More robust parsing for division and complex expressions
   - Better splitting of arguments in nested expressions

3. **Strengthen TFID Identity**:
   - Make TFID more stable under transformations
   - Better fingerprinting for symbolic equivalence

4. **Expand Magic Square Validation**:
   - Support for grids with repeated values but valid symbolic identity
   - Better checking for pseudo-magic properties

5. **General Robustness**:
   - Better error handling throughout the codebase
   - More consistent type handling (float, complex, symbolic)
   - More extensive test suite with edge cases

The UML Calculator shows promise in handling advanced mathematical concepts beyond
traditional calculators, particularly in areas of symbolic compression, identity 
preservation, and meta-operations like RIS. With the suggested improvements, it can
become a powerful tool for mathematical exploration.
