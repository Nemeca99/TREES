## Core Technologies

### T.R.E.E.S. Framework
The Recursive Entropy Engine System (T.R.E.E.S.) is a comprehensive theoretical framework proposing recursion as the foundational pattern underlying reality, consciousness, computation, and complex systems. It unifies concepts across mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence, and philosophy through recursive patterns and entropy minimization principles.

### UML Calculator
The Universal Mathematical Language (UML) Calculator is a practical implementation of the T.R.E.E.S. framework's mathematical components. It demonstrates recursive, symbolic, and identity-based mathematical operations with unique capabilities in pattern recognition, compression, and multi-dimensional mathematics.

### RIS (Recursive Identity System)
The RIS framework proposes a meta-operator that unifies all logical operations recursively, holding operations in superposition and collapsing to the lowest-entropy solution. This system forms the theoretical foundation for both the UML Calculator and AI architectures.

### BlackwallV2
A biomimetic AI architecture implementing T.R.E.E.S. principles through fragment-based identity, dual-hemisphere memory, dream cycles, and recursive processing loops. It demonstrates practical applications of theoretical concepts related to recursive identity and consciousness.

## Getting Started

To explore the UML Calculator functionality:
1. Navigate to the UML_Calculator directory
2. Run `python feature_demo.py` to see demonstrations of key features
3. Explore `uml_core.py` and `symbolic_engine.py` to understand the implementation
