# TREES: Transformative Recursive Emergent Embedding Systems

This repository contains the implementation of the TREES framework, including the UML Calculator and Codex Web Calculator.

## About TREES

The TREES framework explores the fascinating world of recursive mathematical systems, providing tools for:

- Mathematical operations using Unified Mathematical Language (UML)
- Recursive Identity Systems (RIS) operations
- Symbolic algebra through an intuitive web interface
- Magic square analysis and tesseract projections

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nemeca99/TREES.git
cd TREES
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Calculators

Use the unified launcher for easy access to both calculators:

```bash
launch_unified_calculator.bat
```

## Components

### UML Calculator

A powerful mathematical tool for exploring recursive operations, featuring:

- Basic UML syntax and operations
- RIS meta-operator implementations
- Symbolic identity and fingerprinting
- Recursive compression algorithms
- Magic square analysis tools

### Codex Web Calculator

A web-based symbolic algebra interface with:

- Integration with the UML engine
- Memory context for theory reference
- Advanced symbolic processing capabilities
- Intuitive web interface
